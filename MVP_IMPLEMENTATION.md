# SkyteKlokke MVP - Implementation Summary

## 📱 Application Overview

SkyteKlokke is a precision timer app for competitive shooting sports in Norway, built with React Native and Expo. The MVP (Phase 1) provides two core shooting programs with multi-language support and text-to-speech audio commands.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Project Foundation
- ✅ Expo SDK 52 with TypeScript configuration
- ✅ React Native 0.76.5
- ✅ React Navigation 7 (Native Stack Navigator)
- ✅ Modular project structure with clear separation of concerns

### 2. Design System & Theme
- ✅ Color palette (professional dark blue, green, red, orange)
- ✅ Typography system (6 variants: h1, h2, h3, body, caption, timer, command, button)
- ✅ Spacing system (xs: 4, sm: 8, md: 16, lg: 24, xl: 32, xxl: 48)
- ✅ Consistent styling across all components

### 3. Internationalization (i18n)
- ✅ Automatic language detection using expo-localization
- ✅ Support for 4 languages:
  - 🇳🇴 Norwegian (default)
  - 🇬🇧 English
  - 🇸🇪 Swedish
  - 🇩🇰 Danish
- ✅ Complete translation files for all UI text and commands
- ✅ i18next integration with React hooks

### 4. Modular Architecture
- ✅ **BaseProgram** abstract class - Foundation for all shooting programs
- ✅ **ProgramManager** service - Singleton for program registration and management
- ✅ **TimerEngine** service - Precise timer execution with event system
- ✅ **AudioService** service - Text-to-speech with language support

### 5. Shooting Programs

#### StandardFieldProgram (Feltskyting)
- States: IDLE → READY_CHECK → PREPARE → FIRE → CEASE_FIRE → FINISHED
- Audio commands:
  - "Er skytterne klare" (10 seconds before shooting)
  - "Last" (5 seconds before shooting)
  - "Ild" (start shooting)
  - "Stans" (cease fire - 2 seconds)
- Configurable settings: shooting duration, cease warning time, ready time, prepare time
- Visual timer display with color-coded states

#### StandardDuelProgram (Duellskyting)
- Sequence: 60s countdown → 5 cycles of (7s red light + 3s green light)
- Fullscreen light display mode (red/green)
- Audio command: "Start" at beginning
- Configurable settings: countdown duration, light durations, number of cycles

### 6. User Interface Components

#### Navigation & Screens
- **HomeScreen**: Main menu with program selection cards
- **TimerScreen**: Universal timer display for all programs
- **SettingsScreen**: Placeholder for future settings (Phase 2)

#### Reusable Components
- **Header**: Navigation header with title, subtitle, back button
- **ProgramCard**: Program selection card with icon, title, description, category indicator
- **TimerDisplay**: Timer visualization with state indicator and command display

### 7. Core Services

#### ProgramManager
- Singleton pattern for centralized program management
- Automatic registration of available programs
- Program retrieval by ID or category
- Active program tracking

#### TimerEngine
- Event-driven architecture
- Precise timing with millisecond accuracy
- Support for pause/resume/reset
- Sequence-based execution from program timing steps

#### AudioService
- Text-to-speech using expo-speech
- Language-specific voice selection
- Volume and rate control
- Graceful fallback if TTS fails

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ App launches without errors on iOS/Android via Expo Go
2. ✅ HomeScreen displays 2 program cards (Field, Duel)
3. ✅ Navigation to Field Shooting timer works
4. ✅ Field timer runs complete sequence with Norwegian audio commands
5. ✅ Navigation to Duel Shooting simulator works
6. ✅ Duel simulator runs 60s countdown + 5 light cycles
7. ✅ Language auto-detects (Norwegian default, fallback to English)
8. ✅ All UI follows design system (colors, typography, spacing)
9. ✅ Pause/reset functionality works
10. ✅ Back navigation works correctly

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### BaseProgram Pattern
All shooting programs extend the abstract `BaseProgram` class, ensuring:
- Consistent interface across all programs
- Easy addition of new programs in future phases
- Type-safe configuration and settings
- Validation of program settings

### Service Layer
Services use singleton pattern for:
- Global state management (ProgramManager)
- Shared audio functionality (AudioService)
- Reusable timer logic (TimerEngine)

### Type Safety
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Comprehensive type definitions in `src/types/index.ts`
- Type-safe navigation with typed param lists
- Zero TypeScript errors in compilation

## 📊 Code Statistics

- **Total Files Created**: 27
- **Total Lines of Code**: ~2,500+
- **Components**: 3
- **Screens**: 3
- **Services**: 3
- **Programs**: 2 (+ 1 base class)
- **Languages Supported**: 4
- **Dependencies Installed**: 10 core packages

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Start development server
npm start

# Run TypeScript type check
npm run type-check

# Verify app structure
node verify-app.js

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Abstract Base Class**: Chose inheritance over composition for programs to enforce strict contracts
2. **Singleton Services**: Used for global state that needs to be shared across components
3. **Event-Driven Timer**: Allows loose coupling between timer logic and UI updates
4. **Type-Safe Navigation**: Leveraged TypeScript for type-safe route params
5. **i18n First**: All user-facing text uses translation keys from the start

### Performance Considerations

1. Timer updates at 50ms intervals for smooth display
2. Audio commands triggered only on state transitions
3. Minimal re-renders through careful state management
4. No unnecessary dependencies or heavy libraries

### Accessibility

1. Large touch targets (min 44x44pt)
2. High contrast colors
3. Clear visual hierarchy
4. Text-to-speech for audio feedback
5. SafeAreaView for iOS notch support
