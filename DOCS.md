## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Context for AI Agents

### What is SkyteKlokke?
A mobile timer app for Norwegian competitive shooting sports with:
- **Field shooting timer** with precise command sequences
- **Duel shooting simulator** for dry training
- **Silhouette shooting** with rhythm assistance
- **Multi-language support** for Nordic countries
- **Audio training mode** with TTS commands

### Core Architecture (from TEKNISK_DESIGN.md):
```typescript
// All shooting programs extend this base class
abstract class BaseProgram {
  abstract getStates(): object;
  abstract getCommands(): string[];
  abstract getTimingSequence(): TimingStep[];
  abstract validateSettings(settings: object): boolean;
}

// Examples: StandardFieldProgram, DuelProgram, SilhouetteProgram
```

### Development Priority (from PROSJEKTPLAN.md):
1. **Phase 1**: Core timer + BaseProgram architecture
2. **Phase 2**: Field & duel shooting programs
3. **Phase 3**: Silhouette + i18n implementation  
4. **Phase 4**: Polish + additional programs

### Tech Stack:
- React Native 0.76+ with Expo SDK 54
- TypeScript for type safety
- expo-speech for TTS commands
- i18next for internationalization
- Modular plugin architecture

## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow

### Before Any Code Changes:
1. âœ… Read relevant sections of the 3 core documents
2. âœ… Ensure changes align with modular architecture
3. âœ… Add i18n support for user-facing text
4. âœ… Consider audio timing precision requirements

### File Structure (from TEKNISK_DESIGN.md):

## ðŸŽ® User Journey (Context for Features):
1. **Range Officer**: Uses visual timer with precise commands
2. **Competitive Shooter**: Uses audio mode for training without screen
3. **Dry Training**: Uses simulators (duel/silhouette) at home
4. **Multi-lingual**: Automatic language detection for Nordic users
