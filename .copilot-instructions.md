# Copilot Instructions for SkyteKlokke

## Project Context
You are working on **SkyteKlokke**, a precision timer app for competitive shooters and range officers in Norway.

## Required Reading - ALWAYS Reference These Files:
1. **PROSJEKTPLAN.md** - Complete project requirements and phases
2. **TEKNISK_DESIGN.md** - Technical architecture with BaseProgram modular system
3. **I18N_PLAN.md** - Multi-language support (Norwegian, English, Swedish, Danish)

## Core Architecture Principles:
- **Modular Design**: All shooting programs must extend BaseProgram abstract class
- **Audio Precision**: TTS timing must be exact for competitive shooting
- **i18n First**: All text must be translatable through i18next
- **Expo SDK 54**: Use Expo managed workflow for cross-platform development

## Key Components:
- BaseProgram abstract class for all shooting disciplines
- ProgramManager for registering and handling programs
- Audio timing engine with expo-speech
- Multi-language command system

## Code Standards:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Functional components with React Hooks
- Modular program architecture in src/programs/
- Consistent naming: field/, duel/, silhouette/ programs

## When Making Changes:
1. Always check if changes align with PROSJEKTPLAN.md requirements
2. Ensure new features follow TEKNISK_DESIGN.md architecture
3. Add i18n support per I18N_PLAN.md for any user-facing text
4. Test audio timing precision for shooting commands

## Priority Order:
1. Field shooting timer (MVP)
2. Duel shooting simulator  
3. Silhouette shooting with rhythm assistance
4. Additional shooting disciplines

Remember: This app is for serious competitive shooters - precision and reliability are critical!
